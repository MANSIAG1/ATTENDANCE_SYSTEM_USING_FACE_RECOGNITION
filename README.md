Face Comparison:This project compares two images to determine if they contain the same person. It utilizes the face_recognition library to extract face encodings and compare them

Prerequisites
Python 3.x
Required Python libraries: cv2, numpy, face_recognition

Troubleshooting
If you encounter errors, ensure that all dependencies are installed and that the paths to image files are correct.
